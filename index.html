                <div class="one">“Lacie has now designed two promo flyers for my
                    photography business and I have been blown away both times!
                    She gets my brand! It is liberating to know that I can give
                    her a little information and she can create a awesome
                    marketing piece for me! Also, she sends the files to the
                    printer for me. This has made business easier for me! Thank
                    you Lacie!”</div>
                <div class="one">“Lacie did a great job designing a logo, cards
                    & envelopes for our Church, North Side Baptist Church. We
                    love her designs and the ease of working with her. We will
                    definitely use her and recommend her for anyone needing
                    graphic design help.”</div>
                <div class="one">“Lacie is absolutely amazing!!! She made
                    everything that I ever wanted into my save the dates,
                    invitations, RSVPs, info cards, programs, and couple shower
                    invitations. They were all so beautiful and elegant. She was
                    very affordable and accommodating to everything that we
                    wanted. I highly recommend anyone that is getting married to
